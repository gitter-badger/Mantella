<a name="coding-guidelines"></a> Coding Guidelines
---------------------------------------
- Everything should be (thoroughly) **tested**.
- All methods must be **documented**, regardless of the code visibility.
- We usually follow the [Google Style Guides](https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/).

<a name="commit-guidelines"></a> Commit Guidelines
---------------------------------------
Commit messages should be organised as followed:
```
<subject>

<body>

<signature>
```

### Subject
Add a short description (usually no more than 15 words) about the content  of your commit.

### Body
Describe the details of your changes as specific as possible. Do not be afraid to add multiple lines. Please try to make your explanation as specific as possible and avoid vague descriptions.

### Signature [optional]
Optionally, end the commit message of your pull request by signing your work, i.e. adding some contact details.
