-Dragging
->there is some weird qlist error? when moving tab to rightmost position and then dragging out
-->should be fixed????
-Loading Options
-I18N
-populate menu
-->what else should be put into the menu?
-shortcuts
->prevent alt+f4 instant closing
-smart pointers

Ideas:
-maybe move buttons to a standalone widget at the bottom of mainwindow?
->either disable dragging of optionstab or need some reference to it
-disable dragging for optionstab also solves bug 3

Shortcuts:
Ctrl+Q: quit
Ctrl+F4: close tab
Ctrl+S: stop
Ctrl+R: run

"bugs":
1->sidewindow is not closing when optionstab is last tab in it and it gets dragged out
-->also needs check such that mainwindow doesn't close in that case
2->sidewindow can be closed even if it contains optionstab
3->optionstab gui elements are moving if specific options are getting changed
